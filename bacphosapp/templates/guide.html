                        The Search Page hosts the protein list containing all phosphoproteins and their respective phospho-sites, along with a search engine. 
                        Users can search for phospho-sites by UniProt code, gene, or protein name. The search functionality is sensitive and requires users to input their query correctly. 
                        For example, if a user wants to search by UniProt ID, they must enter only the UniProt code.
                        Additionally, users can filter their search results based on the phosphorylated amino acid, using the dropdown menu.

                        In the detailed view of a protein entry in PEDB, users are presented with a comprehensive overview. At the forefront, users immediately encounter the exact phospho-site they clicked on, ensuring precision and clarity in their exploration. Following this, a structured list unveils all phospho-sites associated with the protein. Through the interactive chart, users can focus on specific regions of interest, facilitating a nuanced understanding of phospho-site distribution. Below this visualization, the protein sequence unfolds, with phospho-sites prominently highlighted. This intuitive presentation enables users to pinpoint phospho-sites within the broader protein sequence.<br><br>
                        Additionally, users benefit from convenient access to valuable resources via curated links. While PEDB serves as an invaluable repository for phospho-site data, it is essential to underscore that its purpose is complementary, not substitutive, to established databases such as UniProt, NCBI, PDB etc. Moreover, users have the option to download a PDF file containing the data related to this entry, enabling offline access and further analysis.
