                        The Search Page hosts the protein list containing all phosphoproteins and their respective phospho-sites, along with a search engine. 
                        Users can search for phosphoproteins by UniProt code, gene, or protein name. The search functionality is sensitive and requires users to input their query correctly. 
                        For example, if a user wants to search by UniProt ID, they must enter only the UniProt code.
                        Additionally, users can filter their search results based on the phosphorylated amino acid, using the dropdown menu.

                        When viewing a protein entry in PEDB, users are presented with a comprehensive overview. The detailed view immediately displays the exact phosphosite clicked on, ensuring precision and clarity in exploration. A structured list then reveals all phosphosites associated with the protein, accompanied by a reference button to access studies referencing each phosphosite. If you encounter unpublished results, feel free to reach out to me, and I will provide you with the MS data and the rationale behind the analysis.
                        Through the interactive chart, users can focus on specific regions of interest, facilitating a nuanced understanding of phosphosite distribution. Below this visualization, the protein sequence unfolds, with phosphosites prominently highlighted. This intuitive presentation enables users to pinpoint phosphosites within the broader protein sequence.
                        Additionally, users have the option to download a PDF file containing the data related to this entry, enabling offline access and further analysis. 
                        Furthermore, users benefit from convenient access to valuable resources via curated links. While PEDB serves as an invaluable repository for phosphosite data in <em>E. coli</em>, it is essential to underscore that its purpose is complementary, not substitutive, to established databases such as UniProt, NCBI, and PDB.
