      PhosEcoli serves as an exhaustive repository for protein phosphorylation data within 
      E. coli, comprising a considerable collection of phospho-proteins totaling ***** and 
      identifying **** phospho-sites. Acknowledged as a cornerstone in prokaryotic systems, 
      protein phosphorylation represents an estimated ***% of the total phosphorylated amino 
      acids in E. coli, emphasizing its critical role across diverse cellular processes. 
      Boasting a rich array of annotated phospho-sites, this online database stands as an 
      indispensable resource for researchers delving into protein phosphorylation within the 
      microbial realm. Furthermore, access to the platform is unrestricted and freely available 
      to all users, including commercial entities.
